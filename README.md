# hello-world

Hi everybody!

I'm taking my first steps into a larger world. I always felt a bit nervous because I hadn't learned to program, and the bar to entry seemed so high, but it's time to bite the bullet.

I'm a sociology grad student interested in movements that try to change the world, in figuring out how to use the incredible tools available through machine learning to summarize patterns in the narratives of people's lives, and in figuring out what really matters to people.

Also, I'm really curious as to how different people answer the question of what things are worth dying for. A friend started me thinking about it by reminding me, "You only die once; make it a good one." I have a pretty good sense of what I think a good death is, but I'm very curious how others approach the answer to that question. Drop me a message if you'd like to have that conversation at some point!

Okay, so that was a lot of rambling. See you in the network!
